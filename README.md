## Project Proposal

> **Questions:**  
> What will the application do?  
> Who will use it?  
> Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is an easy-to-use desktop expense tracker.
The user keeps track of their spending by recording entries of their
daily expenses into this application. The spendings are organized into
categories such as food, clothing, or tuition. All entries pertaining to
a particular category can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding
category icon on the homepage. On the homepage, there will also be a list
of spending entries, as well as a field where the user can input
a new entry. Additionally, here could also be a display of the total
spending of the week and related statistical graphs.

Myself could be a potential user of this expense tracker. I have tried to
use similar expense tracking apps on the phone. But for me, they are all
too complicated to use. I want to create a more customizable and simple
expense tracker that can let me see all the important informations in one
window. Anyone can use it if they want a insight into their spending
habits, which may likely be true for many students like me.
