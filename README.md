This project is an easy-to-use desktop expense tracker.
The user keeps track of their daily expenses by recording entries of
expenses into this application. The expenses are organized into
categories such as grocery, clothing, or tuition. All entries pertaining to
a particular category can be viewed by clicking on the corresponding
category icon on the homepage. there will also be a list of all expenses
on the homepage, as well as a field where the user can input
a new entry. Additionally, there are options to view weekly spending
statistics, as will as a statistic showing how much money was spent in
each category

Myself could be a potential user of this expense tracker. I have tried to
use similar expense tracking apps on my phone, but found them
too complicated to use. I want to create a more customizable and simple
expense tracker that can let me see all the important information on one
page. Anyone can use this application if they want a insight into their
spending habits, which may likely be true for many students like me.
